# IntroToCS
Contained is code which exemplifies code that may be written in an intro to CS course. Note that this class was taken my first semester of freshman year so this repository does not reflect my current abilities.

Found this code after dusting out my old dropbox.

The code is unchanged however the filenames may be changed for easier readability.
